					<p>The monk debates at Sera Monastery are a unique experience. This is not the place to explain a lot about what is going on with it, but here is one of the photos I took. monks debating on sera monastery grounds.  The standing monk in the foreground is debating with the seated monk, and his posture reflects that he is winding up to clap his hands forecefully, in one of the debating rituals the monks are known for.</p>

					<p>I saw a yak wandering free on the grounds of the Sera Monastery. I don't know where it was going or where it was coming from. Quite likely, it belonged to the monks. It was not my first yak, but definitely my first yak sighting at a monastery. This is one of about 10 pictures I took of it.</p>

					<h3>Bharkor St </h3>
					<p>Bharkor Square is an old section of Lhasa, which preserves a more traditional village feel, with various traditional markets, shops, and restaurants. As the site of Jokhang Temple, it is also important to pilgrams and to residents who come for religious practicies on a daily basis.

					<h3>Food </h3>
					<p>A very popular food are momos, a type of dumpling, often filled with meat. The ones I had were filled with yak meat. The noodle soup I had for breakfast also included yak meat. Yak meat is very prevalent. It is the most popular meat, kind of the equivalent of beef, but without the competition that beef has in the United States. Tibetans are very reliant upon it. Another traditional breakfast is barley porridge, which I gave a pass. There were some dishes available with vegetables including potatoes, but i was left with the impression that noodles, dumplings, soup, and yak were the main staples. Unfortunately, time was short and on this trip I didnâ€™t have any butter tea ... a preparation of tea which is made with, you guessed it, yak butter.</p>
